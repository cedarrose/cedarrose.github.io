    'I had the privilege of being part of the inaugural cohort of the Microelectronics Commons Scholars Program, which launched this summer. The program featured two immersive phases: a two-week CA DREAMS Cleanroom Gateway at USC’s John O’Brien Nanofabrication Laboratory, where I received hands-on training, followed by a six-week internship.',
    'During the Cleanroom Gateway, I gained skills in wafer cleaning and handling, photolithography, deposition, etching, metrology, machine operation, and cleanroom safety practices. This foundational training prepared me for my internship.',
    'My internship began with cleanroom machine calibration, where I conducted multiple trials of SiO₂ deposition on cleaved silicon wafers to measure and recalibrate the faulty PECVD deposition rate. I then joined the Biomedical Microsystems Laboratory, which focuses on developing micro/nanotechnologies for biomedical applications. Here, I was fascinated by the fabrication process of a novel silicon-polymer neural probe, and I continued my research into the school year.',
    'Programs that offer such comprehensive and specialized training in this specialized industry are exceptionally rare, and I am grateful to have gained such valuable knowledge and experience in this field.',

    'Since July 2024, I\'ve been helping to design, fabricate, and characterize a hybrid silicon-polymer neural recording probe.',
    'This neural probe aims to combine the flexibility of polymer-based neural interfaces and the high electrode density of silicon-based neural interfaces. This hybrid approach enforces high spatial resolution neural recordings while maintaining flexible mechanical properties and biocompatibility required for neural implants. To create this novel neural probe, I am assisting in developing and testing the fabrication procedure for the flexible shank.', 
    'I joined this lab last summer after a month of training in semiconductor fabrication processes in the cleanroom. I was able to translate this knowledge of nanofabrication to the lab’s development of neural interfaces. I truly enjoy the process of creating this device. It’s a ton of trial and error, brainstorming different fabrication methods and figuring out what works and what doesn’t. I can think of at least six different fabrication approaches that we have undertaken, and each approach has many different variations - tweaking the mold CAD file, or the material of the coil, or the method of transferring the coil to the substrate, or the coil-forming strategies.',
    'There are standard fabrication processes for creating neural probes (e.g. photolithography, deposition, etching, liftoff). However, our project requires a new fabrication approach since we are dealing with a much thicker layer of conductive material.',

  abstract: '"Sweat rate measures key physiological states such as hydration levels and heat tolerance. Incorporating wearable technology with sweat rate sensors allows individuals to conveniently monitor their health, optimize workouts, and enhance occupational safety. However, challenges persist in such integration techniques, including intricate manufacturing, nonlinear responses to changes in sweat rates, and errors from the intermediate measurement of the distance sweat travels in the sensor. To address these issues, we present a comprehensive wearable platform that includes a fully printed, flexible sensor patch, readout electronics, and a mobile app for continuous, real-time monitoring of sweat rate. We fabricate a sensor patch with an area of 700 mm2 and a weight of 380 mg by utilizing direct 3D printing and scalable microfluidic fabrication. The microfluidic channels are 850 μm wide and 164 μm thick, with serpentine electrodes measuring sweat rate using capacitance..."',

    'The Khan Lab at USC focuses on wearable sensors for precision health and psychiatry. As a freshman researcher in the Khan Lab I worked on an electrochemical sensing system for potassium ion sensing. My teammate and I developed firmware and hardware for the Analog Front End of an extended gate transistor-based sensor with differential sensing capabilities.',
    'In an extended gate transistor-based electrochemical sensing system, the change in chemical activity of analyte species can be detected in the shift of the silicon transistors’ i-v characteristics. With the transistor gate connected to an appropriate electrochemical sensor, the analyte in contact with the sensor will induce a shift in the transistor’s threshold voltage. To collect this electrochemical data, we needed analog-to-digital conversion and a supply of bias to NMOS transistors through the Analog Front End (AFE). We used Analog Devices’ AD5933 and interfaced it with an Arduino to control the transistors and read the drain-source current.',
    'We created two setups, single-ended and differential printed sensors, and connected the transistor gate to the gold working electrode of the chosen setup. We developed the firmware to interface the Arduino with the digital-to-analog converter (DAC), which provides bias to the NMOS transistors. We created the AFE system from a breadboard, Arduino UNO, and DAC, but I created a PCB layout of the AFE for future use.',
